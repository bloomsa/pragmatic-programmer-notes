#Tip 27: Achieve Editor Fluency

Editor Fluency challenge list
- when editing text; move & make selections by char, word, line, and paragraph
- when editing code; move by syntatic units (matching delimiters, functions, classes/modules)
- Reindent code following changes 
- Comment and uncomment with single command
- Undo and Redo changes
- Split the editor window into multiple panels and navigate between them
- Navigate to a particular line number
- sort selected lines (sort? on what??) - seems context dependent
- Search for strings and regular expressions
- create multiple cursors
- display compilation errors in current project
- run project tests
